* Professor rating system  
* Laboratory information and facilities  
* Industry collaboration details  
* Department syllabus (scraped from official sources)  
* Accreditation information  
* Research papers and publications  
* Unofficial placement data compiled by seniors  
* NIRF reports integration

**Hostels Section:**

* Hostel and PG accommodation listings  
* Room types and pricing information  
* Mess facilities and menu details  
* Hostel rules (entry/exit timings, food ordering policies, appliance permissions)  
* Nearby eateries and alternative mess options  
* Local attractions and points of interest

**Fests Section:**

* Festival listings with budgets  
* Event details with photo galleries  
* Duration and scheduling information

**Clubs Section:**

* Club information and activities  
* Membership requirements and entry processes

### **Interactive Features**

* Polling system for community engagement  
* Q\&A functionality where users can ask and answer questions

## **Data Sources and Management**

* Web scraping from official college websites  
* Student-contributed content and reviews  
* Integration of official reports (NIRF)  
* Community-driven data validation

## **Research Focus Areas**
